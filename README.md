# Reconcile Notes from Nature Transcripts

This a rewrite of Dr. Allen's [label_reconciliations](https://github.com/juliema/label_reconciliations/tree/master) project. My real purpose is not to replace Dr. Allen's work in production -- although that might be nice --, but to learn how to use Zig on a moderately complex project that I am familiar with. It is my first Zig project outside of simple tutorials; I'm certain that the code reveals this.
